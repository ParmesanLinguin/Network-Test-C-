# C# Low-Level (TCP / UDP) Networking Test

This is my first time playing around with lower-level networking in C#. I'm exploring the area for future use inside of video games. A significant portion of this project has come from [tom-weiland/tcp-udp-networking](https://github.com/tom-weiland/tcp-udp-networking/), so thanks to him and his tutorial series for clarifying how TCP is handled in .NET as well as in general.

This project is going to most likely become a framework that I can incorporate later on into my game. I will likely create an example project as well which will act as a server browser using the TCP sockets I've been working on.
